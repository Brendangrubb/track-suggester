          <h2>It seems like the <strong>CSS/Design Track</strong> would be a good fit for you!</h2>
          <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual and aural layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.</p>
          <p>Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Web design is a crucial component in web development, and students who learn design will be able to engineer positive and interactive user experiences through innovative interfaces. </p>
          <p>Each language has a bit of a niche and depending on your interests, you might be attracted to one over another. That being said, don't stress too much about making the right choice! Most modern programming languages have more similarities than differences and Epicodus graduates often find themselves working in different languages than they studied in school.</p>
